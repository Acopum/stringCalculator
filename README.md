##Description

The Java application was developed by following tests for features. The application currently calculates the sum given a string of delimiters and numbers in the following format:

//[delimiters separated by ',']\n[numbers separated by delimiters]

The string calculator handles negative numbers and numbers larger than 1000 using error and console messages. Additionally, multiple delimiters and multiple delimiter lengths are handled properly.
